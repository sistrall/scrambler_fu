h1. ScramblerFu

Basically scrambles the content of a table.

h2. Usage case

Say you have a dump of your real DB that you want to take home with 
you from work. In the same time you really don't want to have matters
with privacy, private data and similar.

Problem solved: after a scramble you'll have your DB full of random data.

h2. Usage

Define a model as usable with this plugin with @acts_as_scramblable@

  class User < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_scramblable :email => :letters,
                        :name => :order,
                        :code => [:numbers, :letters]
  end

Than you can execute a task using rake:

  rake db:scramble
