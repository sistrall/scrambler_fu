h1. ScramblerFu

Basically: scrambles contents of tables.

h2. Usage case

Say you have a dump of your real DB that you want to take home with you from work. In the same time you really don't want to have trouble with privacy, private data and similar.

After a scramble you'll have your DB full of random data. Problem solved!

h2. Usage

Define a model as usable with this plugin with @acts_as_scramblable@

bc. class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  acts_as_scramblable :email => :letters,
                      :name => :order,
                      :code => [:numbers, :letters]
end

p. Than you can execute a task using rake:

bc. rake db:scramble
